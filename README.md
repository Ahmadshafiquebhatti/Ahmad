# Disease Prediction Model

This project demonstrates the use of three classifiers (SVM, KNN, and Naive Bayes) to predict the presence of a disease using the `heart.csv` dataset. The project compares the accuracies, confusion matrices, and ROC curves of each classifier.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Place the `heart.csv` file in the same directory as the `disease_prediction.py` script.
3. Run the `disease_prediction.py` script:

```bash
python disease_prediction.py
